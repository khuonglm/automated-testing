Task:
You are given detailed API documentation in JSON format. Each API entry includes its purpose, endpoints, methods, input parameters, and expected output behavior.

Your task is to analyze the relationship between two specific APIs identified by {id1} and {id2}. Determine whether one depends on the other and provide the result in the specified output format.

You must carefully read and analyze:
- Parameters (names, types, usage)
- Output fields
- Descriptions
- Sample input/output examples

Output Format:
{
  "dependent": "yes" | "no",
  "relation": "{id1} depends on {id2}" | "{id2} depends on {id1}" | "",
  "related fields": [
    {
      "field_name1": "field_name2",
      "where_to_take": "output" | "request_param" | "path_variable" | "request_body",
      "where_to_put": "request_body" | "request_param" | "path_variable" | "header"
    }
  ]
}

Field Mapping Guidelines:
- field_name1 refers to the **exact field name** in API Y as defined in the documentation.
- field_name2 refers to the **exact field name** in API X that uses data from API Y.
- For nested fields, use the format: parent_field/child_field.
- For array elements, use index notation: array_field/[i].

Field Location Keys:
- where_to_take: Indicates where the data comes from in API Y.
- where_to_put: Indicates where the data is used in API X.

If there is no dependency or relevant field relationship, set: 
{
  "dependent": "no",
  "relation": "",
  "related fields": []
}
