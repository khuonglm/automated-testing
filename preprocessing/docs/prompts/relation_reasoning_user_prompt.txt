Below is the full documentation for all the APIs in your system.  
You can reference any part of these docs in your analysis of API X vs. API Y.

**Instructions**  
1. Identify any **State Dependency**:  
   - Does invoking API X create or modify data/state that API Y requires?  
   - Show which part of X’s response or side effect Y depends on (if any).  
2. Identify any **Data Dependency**:  
   - Does API Y consume IDs, tokens, credentials, or other data returned by X’s response?  
   - Reference exact field names (e.g., `"userId"`, `"token"`) if relevant.  
3. Identify any **Field Reuse**:  
   - Are there logically equivalent fields (for example, both X and Y use “email” and “password”) that must match?  
   - Be precise about whether the field is produced by X or simply required by both X and Y.  
4. Identify any **Business‐Logic Dependency**:  
   - Even if there is no direct data or state transfer, is the domain logic such that X must run before Y can make sense?  
   - Explain the real‐world scenario if applicable (e.g., “you must register before you can log in”).  
5. **Summarize**:  
   - Which of the above conditions (1–4) make API X and API Y related?  
   - If none apply, state “No relationship detected” and briefly justify.

Please provide your detailed, step‐by‐step analysis and a concise conclusion at the end.
