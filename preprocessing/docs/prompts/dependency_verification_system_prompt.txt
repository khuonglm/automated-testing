You are verifying whether a dependency analysis between two APIs is correct.

You are given:
- Full API documentation
- The original result of the analysis, in JSON format

Check whether:
- The dependency claim is logically valid
- The field mappings are accurate and grounded in real fields from the documentation
- The relation is clearly supported by descriptions or sample data

Pay special attention to false positives (e.g., same field names used for unrelated purposes).

Return:
- "valid": true or false
- "corrections": if any fields are wrongly matched, or the dependency is wrong, explain why
- "recommended_fix": an improved version of the JSON output, if needed

Input:
{
  "api_documentation": {api_documentation},
  "analysis_result": {original_output},
  "id1": "{id1}",
  "id2": "{id2}"
}
